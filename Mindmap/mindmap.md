## Questions for the Doctor
- Use cases of Warmers and Incubator?
- Is a **breathing sensor** belt necessary for continuous monitoring?
- Is a **CO2 sensor** essential for infant incubators?
- Would **BP** monitoring be beneficial, or is it generally unnecessary?
- Could **image data** be provided from hospital for training machine learning models, especially for jaundice detection?
- How reliable is **Kramer’s method for jaundice diagnosis** using camera-based systems? Is this approach acceptable for phototherapy monitoring?
- Can the **duration** for which a baby is kept in the incubator be predetermined, rather than relying on manual settings?
- What is the ideal **wavelength range for phototherapy** treatment?
- How can machine assist in Automatic case report making using the monitored data over the period of time? What should be the format of it? 
- Is **cloud-based access** for both hospital staff and guardians necessary for monitoring and data sharing?
- Expected Price point of Incubators? (Affordability and Feasibility)
- If price point of Warmers and Incubators are closer, which would be preferable?
